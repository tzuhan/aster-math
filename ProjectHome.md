Audio System For Technical Readings was developed as part of my PhD Thesis at Cornell in 1994. The system produces high-quality aural renderings of technical documents authored in the TeX family of markup languages.

This code is being released as-is with permission from my adviser at Cornell, Prof. David Gries.

The code runs on Linux under CLisp using a Dectalk Express, and is being made available under the GPL  for researchers in the field.
